                    <h3>Video Calls</h3>
                    <p>Video calls are by far the best thing to communicate. A video call with you at night or at any time of the day can do things that anything else couldn't. Just seeing you and talking to you relieves me of my problems. Although I can't wipe off your tears over video call, it helps us to stay with each other when we are sad and cannot meet personally.</p>

                    <h3>Lonavala Trip</h3>
                    <p>They say, love is the food of life and travelling is the dessert. Can't quantify the amount of happiness I get when i am travelling with you. I have been to Lonavala before, but being with you was a whole other experience. We have had our ups and downs because of my foolish self, but spending time with you at such a beautiful face in such a nice climate, was the time I would never forget. Can't apologize enough for spoiling your mood at the end, but it was a memorable trip for me, as I had all that I love besides me.</p>

                    <p>The best time I have is when I am with you. More than anything I want is to spend my time with you, as no amount of time spent with you is enough. I love to cherish each moment with you. This card includes some of the many best moments I have had, just because you were there.</p>
